pictures of my life then revealing a door with sound

	- [Left] will transform to have tight walls on the path
	and show torch light eventually leading back to the start of Level 2
		- *Hide and Go Seek*
	- [Center] will transform a room of off brand coins, after a certain amount
	are picked up (8), player will fall and fade to black then back to Level 2
		- *Theivery and Greed*

	between them. Once Grabbed will open a door to Level 3
